# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Village Registry System.

## Logo

Place your official logo file as `logo.png` in this directory. The logo should be:
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or similar square dimensions
- Will be displayed at 80x80 pixels in the birth certificate

If no logo file is present, the image will not display but the certificate will still generate properly.
